# BurnOut-Bot-ChangeLater
Pavia &amp; Lendzian Final Project - OSU ART 4201 Fall 2022

<b>Artists' Statement</b>
<p>
<text-indent>Burnout Bot is a mixed media work that represents the consequences of overworking oneself. Through the use of a game-like interface, the viewer is invited to click a button and earn points. However, as the points accumulate, the robot character begins to show signs of distress, from a happy face to a sad face to tears and eventually leaking oil. This representation of a machine breaking down under the weight of excessive labor is a commentary on the dangers of pushing oneself or others too hard in the pursuit of success. By exposing the negative effects of overwork, Burnout Bot invites viewers to consider the importance of work-life balance and the value of self-care.
